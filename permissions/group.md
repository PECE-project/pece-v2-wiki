# Group permissions

All content is public, but you can change this using the `Permission by Group` field.

1) Add group name in the first field.
2) Uncheck Public visibility.
3) Select the permission this group can have.

## <a name="usergroup"></a>How add user in the group

1) Edit user
2) Add group in the Group field.

## <a name="grouprole"></a>Add group and role permission

If you add group and role permission, only role in the group has access.

For example, you add:

- Groups
    - group1
    - group2
- Roles
    - Researcher (view and edit)
    - Contribuitor (view)

Then

Author can view, edit and delete
Researcher in group1 and group2 can view and edit content
Contribuitors in the group1 and group2 can only view.
